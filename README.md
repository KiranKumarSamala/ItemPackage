Each thing you put inside the package has such parameters as index number, weight and cost. The package has a weight limit. 

Constraints:

- The sum of item weight should be less than package weight.
- Maximum weight of an item should be less than or equal to 100.
- Maximum cost of and item should be less than or equal to 100.
- There might only up to 15 items to select the sequence.

##Approach 
TDD approach is followed 

## Algorithm
Backtracking with Memoization
 
## Design Pattern
 * Inversion of control / Dependency Injection -- PackingService and test cases 
 * Single-responsiblity Principle
